## About The Project

This is the project from the Udacity nano program for full stack - "Inro to Web Development".

As the outcome of practicing HTML and CSS, this project introduces my favorite animal, aka the best animal in the whole world, Cooper!

The size is off to fulfill the rubric of the project grading.
